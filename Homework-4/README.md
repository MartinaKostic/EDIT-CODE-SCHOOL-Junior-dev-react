# Homework 4

The task was to create a React application that, upon starting, fetches five questions and stores them within a component. The user is shown the first question along with potential answers. The goal was to implement as many of the following functionalities as possible:

Allow the user to answer the current question and display whether the answer was correct or not.
After answering, display the next question.
Show the total number of questions and the current question number on the screen.
Display the user's current score.
After the game ends, offer the user the option to play again (with new questions).

Some of the advanced features included offering the user the ability to choose the difficulty level, category, or number of questions before starting the game.
